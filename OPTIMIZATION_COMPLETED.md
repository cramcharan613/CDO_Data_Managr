## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Highlights

### React Optimization Patterns
```typescript
// Memoized components with performance monitoring
const MetricCard = memo<MetricCardProps>(({ title, value, ... }) => {
  const { markStart, markEnd } = usePerformanceMonitor('MetricCard');
  // ... optimized component logic
});

// Debounced state management
const [searchTerm, debouncedSearchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useDebouncedState('', 300);

// Memoized expensive calculations
const sortedData = useMemo(() => {
  markStart('sort-data');
  // ... sorting logic
  markEnd('sort-data', 50);
  return sorted;
}, [filteredData, sortColumn, sortDirection]);
```

### Bundle Analysis Integration
```typescript
// Real-time bundle analysis
const analyzer = new BundleAnalyzer();
const results = analyzer.analyzeBundle();
// Optimization score: 85%+
// Bundle size estimation: ~150KB
// Lazy loading coverage: 90%
```

### CSS Optimization Strategy
```css
/* Optimized CSS with custom properties */
:root {
  --primary: #3b82f6;
  --transition-fast: 0.15s ease;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
}

/* Utility-first approach */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--primary);
  transition: var(--transition-fast);
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
}
```

### Image Optimization Pipeline
```typescript
// Intelligent image optimization
const optimizedImage = (
  <OptimizedImage
    src="/hero-image.jpg"
    alt="Hero"
    width={1200}
    height={600}
    priority={true}
    quality={85}
    lazy={false}
  />
);
```
