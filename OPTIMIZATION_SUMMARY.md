- **Debugging:** Enhanced with structured logging and performance tracking
- **Monitoring:** Production-ready with external service integration capability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Memoization Strategy
```typescript
// Example of optimized component memoization
const WorkflowNode = memo<NodeProps>(({ node, isSelected, onClick }) => {
  const nodeTypeInfo = useMemo(() =>
    NODE_TYPES.find(nt => nt.id === node.type), [node.type]);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onClick(node.id);
  }, [onClick, node.id]);

  // Component implementation with performance monitoring
});
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
```typescript
// Performance tracking in components
const { markStart, markEnd } = usePerformanceMonitor('FlowEditor');

const handleExpensiveOperation = useCallback(() => {
  markStart('expensive-operation');
  // ... expensive computation
  markEnd('expensive-operation', 100); // 100ms threshold
}, [markStart, markEnd]);
```

### Error Boundary Implementation
```typescript
// Multi-level error boundary usage
<PageErrorBoundary pageName="FlowEditor">
  <ComponentErrorBoundary componentName="WorkflowCanvas">
    <WidgetErrorBoundary widgetName="NodePalette">
      <NodePalette />
    </WidgetErrorBoundary>
  </ComponentErrorBoundary>
</PageErrorBoundary>
```
